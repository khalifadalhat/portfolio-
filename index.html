                <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                <p> Hi, my name is Khalifa Dalhat from Kaduna State University(KASU) and I am currently in 300level. I was born and raised here in Kaduna State and grew up here.

                   I am an interesting, fun loving guy with a good sense of humor. One thing about me that is important to know though is that at first I come as a very shy individualistic guy but once I get to know people and are comfortable with my environment I am great. It is hard for me to make friends but once I make them, it’s great and I am all different. I joke, laugh and humor people and I also get as much as I give. I am a very kind, compassionate, sensitive guy as my close friends will tell you. I have a tough shell but on the inside I am soft. I am also a very principled person and stand strong on what is right and wrong. I am also a very straight and honest person. 
                   <p>Academically I am a student who likes to be mentally challenged and I enjoy both hands on projects as well as conventional learning. I am an enthusiastic Computer Science student and I love to write codes. I decided to get deep into computer programming because there are many options in the career by having the ability to produce an operating system, or a game for the world. Computer programming would help me explore many opportunities in life to find a job. As a Programmer i can work independently, or in a big company. Programmers have and are creating the future for computers. </p>
                    
               </p>
               <p> I specifically chosen programming because Computer programmers have a wide range on what they can do. Computer programmers write the detailed list of instructions the computer will follow in the software (Great Sample Resume). This is also called “coding.” Programmers test their software, or other peoples, to see if it works properly (Career Cruising). Programmers study the tasks that the program will…show more content…
                   The programmer will either have to go to the business or the home in some sort of transportation, or by using his own computer. If the programmer is working on certain software for his clients, then he may have built it in a way to assist them from his computer.
                   All jobs need some sort of qualifications to work at that specific job. As a programmer, the person may not go very far if they only have a high school degree. Most employers require programmers to have at least a bachelor’s degree (Education Portal). Some higher-ranking jobs may even require a master’s degree (Education Portal). Some qualifications may be as simple as having a certain amount of experience (Education Portal). With an advanced degree and certain knowledge, a programmer could become a software engineer (Education Portal). Certain employers and jobs may want the programmer to have great technical skills, and programming needs in the businesses (Education Portal).
                   Other than going to school and getting a degree, employers may want more experience and more skills then the programmer may have. During college the programmer most likely spent an abundant amount of time programming for class and maybe some of their own projects. The programmer may get an internship and be supervised so they will eventually get the experience they need (Education Portal). Later down the road in life they my need more experience to get a higher up job. Experience and maybe more
